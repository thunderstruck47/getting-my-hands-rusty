Implementing stuff with Rust

## What should i do?
Below I outline some mini-project ideas related to topics that I am currently exploring. 

### 1. Algorithms Benchmarking
- Implement a few sorting algorithms
- Run them against sets of items which are increasing in size
- Benchmark and plot the results

### 2. Linear Algebra Primer
- Implement vector, matrices and basic operations
- Norm, Determinant, Rank, Inverse
- Implement an algorithm to solve a system of linear equations

### 3. Distributed Machine Learning
- Implement a learning algorithm that can be distributed (i.e. via Map Reduce)
- Distribute to multiple cores of a sigle machine (make sure that the underlying library used for the calculations does not do already do that)
- Distribute to multiple machines
- Benchmark and plot the results
